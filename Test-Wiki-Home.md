## Experimental Markdown

This is just a test to _see_ what kinds of **markdown** translate from VSTS to GitHub.

Here's some lists:
- Unordered item
- Another

More:
1. Test
2. This
3. List

Apparently I can also code some HTML right in here but I'm not sure what the restrictions are. Like, &lt;script&gt; actually seemed to be interpreted (<blink> wasn't). I dunno what VSTS's Paste as HTML button does. Horizonal rule works though:
<hr>

- [x] Checkboxes
- [ ] Are useful

I'm sure attachments won't work
[empty.txt](.attachments/empty-f17aff4a-13bb-43fd-b37f-4ad3ec5bda0f.txt)
[empty.txt](.attachments/empty-91a598a5-23cd-411d-a09b-29c38e7dcf1b.txt)

Or work item references
#2
#1 
wait a minute how does this project's wiki have access to that project's work items my mind is blown.

Curious about other wiki pages though
[Subpage for test wiki](/Subpage-for-test-wiki)
Man I am surprised there's not a better way to link that than to drag it in from the list of pages...

Some code:
```
10 PRINT "I WILL NOT CODE IN BASIC"
20 GOTO 10
```
